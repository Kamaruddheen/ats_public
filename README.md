Applicant tracking system

# TODO
- Use pylint suggestions from workflow and improve the coding style in the following order:
  - imports style issues
  - module naming
  - function docstring
  - function naming (ignore method names inside applicants/models.py beause these are django specific)
  - ignore other (class, methods, variable, constants) naming for now. The current variable naming is consistent therefore, change the test to support that naming convention.
- Add tests to check models
- Add tests to check pages
- Add tests to check js using selenium
